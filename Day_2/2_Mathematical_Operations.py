# Addition Operation
3+5
# Subtraction Operation
7-4
# Multiplication Operation
3*2
# Division - Has two versions:
# prints in float
print(6 / 3)  # = 2.0
# prints in int
print(6 // 2)  # = 3
# Exponents Operation
print(2 ** 3)  # = 8


# Example
print(3*3+3/3-3)  # = 7.0
print(3 * 3 + 3 // 3 - 3)  # = 7
